# Fictional Railway Editor (Legacy Frontend)

This is a legacy version of a fictional railway editor, specifically for me to fantasize an enlarged-version of Hong Kong. This frontend was written with Nuxt.js & Vue.js, and is now being re-written to a new frontend with more generalized features (e.g. without hard-coding map graphics into the system like this so).

This is a discontinued project, and the codes are for studying purpose only.
